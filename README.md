## **US Pollen Data Visualization Website**

### Our website shows monthly maximum pollen counts across the US from 1997 to 2016. 

We built this website using HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON files, and constructed the JSON files using Python. It includes data for four different pollen types: Deciduous (DBF), Evergreen (ENF), Grasses, and Ragweed. For each month, we created a contour map showing pollen levels from the day with the highest pollen count in that month (maximum pollen count). Pollen levels are used from those generated by the PECM model. 

Our goal is to visualize pollen levels across the US in order to observe trends in pollen levels with climate change as well as to visualize regional allergen levels. This tool shows changes in pollen count over time, with a time slider and animate feature to observe changes and trends.

Notes:
* Works best in Safari. If using Safari, let data load once (by moving slider) to make animation more fluid.
* We used Leaflet to power the map and GeoJSON to visualize the contours. The original data is stored as text files, which we then converted to GeoJSON using txttojson.py.

Future to-do:
* Add data for all pollen types, which shows monthly maximum pollen counts of the four individual types combined.
* Make website load layers faster in Chrome and other non-Safari browsers.
