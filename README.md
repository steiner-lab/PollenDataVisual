# **US Pollen Data Visualization Website**

### Our website shows monthly maximum pollen levels across the US from 1997 to 2016. 

We built this website using HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON files, and constructed the JSON files using Python. It includes data for four different pollen types: Deciduous (DBF), Evergreen (ENF), Grasses, and Ragweed. For each month, we created a contour map showing pollen levels from the day with the highest pollen count in that month (maximum pollen count). Pollen levels are used from those generated by the PECM model. 

Notes:
* Works best in Safari. If using Safari, let data load once (by moving slider) to make animation more fluid.
